Last Update: August 2023

This repository holds the computational Jupyter Notebooks needed for analysis of the CESM2 model data from the CESM2 Large Ensemble and the SMOOTH model experiments. These tools are used for a manuscript investigating how surface roughness impacts near surface winds and sea ice mean state and trends. The repository also contains the computational notebooks needed for processing SMOOTH ensemble member data as well as the fortran code modifications used for the SMOOTH model experiments.
